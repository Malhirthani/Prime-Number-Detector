# Prime-Number-Detector
This is a Python program that checks if the input number is a prime number or not, easy to under stand!!
Fisrt I made an embty set to be used for later.
Then, I made a functiont
inside that function there is a for loop that contains an if condition which stores the factors fo the given number in a set.
After that, I made another if condition inside the funstion that checks the set:
        1- if the set contains more than 2 itmes, then it is NOT a prime number
        2- else the it is a Prime Number
#You can also use the function to return the factors of an input number!!
